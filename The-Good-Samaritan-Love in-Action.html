            <h2>I. The Question of Inheritance and Neighborliness</h2>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> Luke 10:25-29</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Lawyer's Question:</strong> A lawyer asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus responds by asking him to summarize the law (Luke 10:25-26).</li>
                <li><strong>Summary of the Law:</strong> The lawyer correctly answers, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and, love your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 10:27).</li>
                <li><strong>Seeking Justification:</strong> The lawyer then asks, "And who is my neighbor?" seeking to justify himself (Luke 10:29).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The lawyer's question sets the stage for Jesus to redefine the concept of neighborliness, challenging the boundaries of who we are called to love.</p>

                <li><strong>The Samaritan's Compassion:</strong> A Samaritan, despite cultural enmity, takes pity on the man. He bandages his wounds, takes him to an inn, and cares for him, even paying for his further needs (Luke 10:33-35).</li>

            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The Samaritan's actions exemplify true neighborly love. He goes beyond societal boundaries and shows mercy, embodying love through his actions.</p>

            <h2>IV. Application: Living Out Neighborly Love</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>See with Compassion:</strong>
                    <p>Open your eyes to the needs around you. Ask God to give you a compassionate heart that is moved to action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Matthew 9:36:</strong> "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Break Down Barriers:</strong>
                    <p>Challenge your own prejudices and be willing to reach out to those who are different from you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Galatians 3:28:</strong> "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Act with Mercy:</strong>
                    <p>Let your love be evident through tangible acts of kindness and mercy, especially to those who cannot repay you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Micah 6:8:</strong> "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Commit to Ongoing Love:</strong>
                    <p>Make neighborly love a consistent part of your life, not just a one-time act.</p>
                    <p><strong>1 John 3:18:</strong> "Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth."</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
