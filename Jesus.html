    <h1>Sermon: Is Jesus Sleeping?</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>In Mark 4:35-40, we find the story of Jesus calming the storm. The disciples were in the midst of a fierce storm, and they found Jesus sleeping in the boat. They asked, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” Jesus got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” The storm ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>

    <h2>Key Text: Mark 4:35-40</h2>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, 'Let us go over to the other side.' Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?' He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!' Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, 'Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?'" – Mark 4:35-40
    </blockquote>

    <h2>1. Why Was Jesus Sleeping?</h2>
    <p>The fact that Jesus was asleep during the storm shows His complete trust in God the Father. He wasn’t worried or anxious because He knew that His Father was in control of all things. Even though Jesus, in His humanity, needed rest, His divine nature was fully aware of everything going on.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "He will not let your foot slip—he who watches over you will not slumber; indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep." – Psalm 121:3-4
    </blockquote>

    <h2>2. Faith in the Midst of Storms:</h2>
    <p>Jesus rebuked the disciples for their lack of faith. The storm was real, but so was their Savior’s presence with them. Many times, we face storms in life, but Jesus reminds us not to be afraid and to trust in Him.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze." – Isaiah 43:2
    </blockquote>

    <h2>3. Jesus Has Authority Over Nature:</h2>
    <p>When Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, they obeyed immediately. This shows His absolute authority over nature and creation. Just as He calmed the storm for the disciples, He has the power to calm the storms in our lives.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "The wind and the waves obey him." – Matthew 8:27
    </blockquote>

    <h2>4. Jesus Cares for Us in the Storm:</h2>
    <p>The disciples asked Jesus, “Don’t you care if we drown?” This question reflects their fear, but Jesus deeply cared. In our moments of fear and doubt, we must remember that Jesus is always present and caring.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." – 1 Peter 5:7
    </blockquote>

    <h2>5. Jesus Calls Us to Have Faith:</h2>
    <p>When Jesus asked, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?” He was calling the disciples to trust Him more. Even in life’s challenges, we are called to respond with faith, knowing that Jesus is with us in every situation.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see." – Hebrews 11:1
    </blockquote>

    <h2>6. Peace in the Storms of Life:</h2>
    <p>Jesus brings peace in the midst of storms. Even when things around us seem chaotic, Jesus speaks peace into our hearts, calming our fears and anxieties.</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        "And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." – Philippians 4:7
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Just like the disciples in the boat, we will face storms in our lives. But we must remember that Jesus is with us. He has the power to calm the storm, and He cares deeply for us. Though it may sometimes feel like He is “sleeping,” He is fully aware and in control. Our response should be one of faith and trust in Him.</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>"Lord Jesus, we thank You for Your presence with us in the storms of life. Help us to have faith in You, even when it feels like You are far away. We trust in Your power and Your care for us. In Jesus' name, Amen."</p>
