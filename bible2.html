      <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
      <div class="verse">
        <p><strong>Colossians 3:13 (NIV):</strong> "Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Forgiveness is a cornerstone of Christian living and is crucial for maintaining unity within the Church. Jesus emphasized the importance of forgiving one another, reflecting God’s forgiveness toward us. This lesson will explore the biblical basis for forgiveness, its role in fostering unity, and practical examples from Scripture.</p>

      <h2>1. The Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35)</h2>
      <img src="https://scottandsadie.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unforgiving_servant1.jpg" alt="The Unforgiving Servant">
      <p>Jesus tells the parable of the unforgiving servant to illustrate the necessity of forgiveness. Key points include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forgiveness Granted:</strong> A king forgives a servant a massive debt (Matthew 18:27).</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to Forgive:</strong> The same servant refuses to forgive a small debt owed to him (Matthew 18:28).</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> The king punishes the unforgiving servant, showing that forgiveness must be reciprocal (Matthew 18:34-35).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lesson">Lesson: Forgiveness is not optional for believers. Just as we have been forgiven by God, we must extend forgiveness to others. Failure to do so can have serious spiritual consequences.</p>
