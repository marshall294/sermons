            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In Mark 10:42-45, Jesus teaches His disciples about true greatness in the kingdom of God. Contrary to the world's standards, greatness in God's eyes is measured by service and humility. Today, we will explore Jesus' call to serve and how we can embody this in our daily lives.</p>

            <h2>IV. Application: Living a Life of Service</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Opportunities:</strong>
                    <p>Look for opportunities to serve others in your community, church, and daily interactions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Galatians 6:10:</strong> "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Serve with Humility:</strong>
                    <p>Approach service with a humble heart, putting others' needs above your own.</p>
                    <p><strong>Philippians 2:3-4:</strong> "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reflect on Jesus' Example:</strong>
                    <p>Regularly reflect on Jesus' life and teachings to inspire and guide your own service to others.</p>
                    <p><strong>John 13:14-15:</strong> "Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one anotherâ€™s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Serve with Love:</strong>
                    <p>Let love be the motivation behind your acts of service, reflecting God's love to those around you.</p>
                    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 13:3:</strong> "If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
