            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In our lives, we are constantly faced with the challenge of discerning who to listen to. This question is crucial for our spiritual journey. Today, we delve into 1 Kings 13, a chapter that presents us with three key figures: Jeroboam, the man of God, and the old prophet. Their interactions offer profound lessons about obedience, deception, and the importance of listening to God's voice above all others.</p>

            <h2>I. The Man of God: Obedience to God's Command</h2>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> 1 Kings 13:1-10</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context:</strong> Jeroboam, king of Israel, had led the people into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan. God sent a man of God from Judah to prophesy against the altar Jeroboam had built.</li>
                <li><strong>Message Delivered:</strong> The man of God boldly declared God's judgment on the altar, predicting the birth of Josiah, who would defile it (1 Kings 13:2).</li>
                <li><strong>Sign of Confirmation:</strong> The altar was split apart, and ashes poured out, as a sign of the authenticity of the man of God's message (1 Kings 13:3-5).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The man of God demonstrated obedience and courage. He listened to God's specific instructions and delivered the message despite the risk involved. This teaches us the importance of unwavering obedience to God's word, even when it is difficult or dangerous.</p>

            <h2>II. Jeroboam: Rejection and Partial Obedience</h2>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> 1 Kings 13:4-6</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> Jeroboam's immediate reaction was hostility. He stretched out his hand to seize the man of God, and his hand withered as a result (1 Kings 13:4).</li>
                <li><strong>Change of Heart:</strong> After his hand was restored following the man of God's prayer, Jeroboam offered hospitality to the man of God, which was refused (1 Kings 13:6-10).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Jeroboam's initial rejection followed by partial obedience shows a superficial change of heart. His offer of hospitality, likely an attempt to manipulate or reward the prophet, was not aligned with genuine repentance. True obedience to God requires a transformation of heart and sustained commitment, not just temporary compliance when convenient.</p>

            <h2>III. The Old Prophet: Deception and Its Consequences</h2>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> 1 Kings 13:11-32</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deceptive Invitation:</strong> The old prophet, living in Bethel, heard of the man of God's actions and deceitfully invited him to his home, claiming an angel had instructed him to bring the man of God back (1 Kings 13:18).</li>
                <li><strong>Disobedience and Judgment:</strong> Believing the lie, the man of God returned with the old prophet, disobeying God's direct command not to eat or drink in Bethel. Consequently, the man of God was killed by a lion on his way home (1 Kings 13:19-24).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> This tragic outcome underscores the danger of being led astray by others, even those who seem trustworthy or claim spiritual authority. It is a stark reminder to hold fast to God's word and seek discernment. We must prioritize God's instructions over any conflicting voices.</p>

            <h2>Application: Who Do We Listen To?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>God's Word Above All:</strong>
                    <p>In an age of competing voices and opinions, Scripture must remain our ultimate guide. Regular study and meditation on God's word will fortify us against deception.</p>
                    <p><strong>Psalm 119:105:</strong> "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Spiritual Discernment:</strong>
                    <p>Pray for discernment to recognize true guidance from God and distinguish it from misleading influences.</p>
                    <p><strong>1 John 4:1:</strong> "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accountability and Community:</strong>
                    <p>Surround yourself with a community of believers who encourage adherence to biblical truth and hold each other accountable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proverbs 27:17:</strong> "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heeding Warnings:</strong>
                    <p>Learn from the examples in Scripture. Jeroboam’s superficial repentance and the old prophet’s deception are cautionary tales that highlight the consequences of not fully adhering to God's commands.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

Let us commit to discerning His guidance and following it faithfully, ensuring that our lives reflect His will and purpose.</p>
