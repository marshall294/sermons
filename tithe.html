    <h3>Presenter: Brother Marshall Jacob</h3>
    <p>In the New Testament, the concept of giving undergoes a significant transformation compared to the Old Testament practice of tithing. This page explores how the early Church approached giving and what principles guide Christian generosity today.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>While the Old Testament law mandated tithing—giving a tenth of one’s income to God—this specific practice is not emphasized in the New Testament as a requirement for Christians. Instead, the New Testament presents a different approach to giving, focusing on generosity and willingness rather than a fixed percentage.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>2 Corinthians 9:7 – "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>New Testament Teachings on Giving</h3>
    <p>The New Testament emphasizes several key principles regarding giving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Voluntary and Cheerful Giving:</strong> Believers are encouraged to give freely and with joy, rather than being bound by a fixed percentage.</li>
        <li><strong>Generosity Over Obligation:</strong> Giving is to come from the heart and reflect the love and grace of God, rather than adhering to a rigid rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting the Work of the Church:</strong> Financial contributions are intended to support the needs of the church and its mission, including caring for the poor and advancing the gospel.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Acts 20:35 – "In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="early-church-practice">Early Church Practices</h2>
    <p>The early Church’s approach to giving can be seen in several key practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acts of Generosity:</strong> Believers shared their possessions and resources to meet the needs of others, exemplifying communal living and mutual support (Acts 2:44-45).</li>
        <li><strong>Support for Ministers:</strong> The apostles and early leaders were supported by the contributions of the church, enabling them to focus on ministry and teaching (1 Corinthians 9:14).</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Galatians 6:6 – "Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While tithing as a strict requirement is not practiced in the New Testament, the principles of generous and voluntary giving are deeply ingrained in Christian teachings. Believers are called to give according to their ability and willingness, reflecting God's grace and love in their generosity.</p>
