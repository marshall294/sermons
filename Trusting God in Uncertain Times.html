            <h2>I. Trust in the Lord with All Your Heart</h2>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> Proverbs 3:5a</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete Trust:</strong> Trusting God requires complete confidence in His character and His promises. It means relying on Him wholeheartedly.</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Commitment:</strong> The heart in biblical terms represents the center of our emotions, will, and intellect. Trusting God with all our heart means surrendering every part of our lives to Him.</li>
